        workout: 'Bench Press',
        instruction: `The bench press is one of the most effective exercises for developing and strengthening the upper body. However, despite its effectiveness, it’s also the one exercise that lifters seem to have the most trouble with; primarily due to shoulder pain when benching or after benching. And in many cases, this is simply a result of various tweaks that need to be made in your bench press form. In this video, I’ll go through exactly how to bench without pain and how to permanently avoid shoulder pain when benching.
        The first bench press form mistake people make that causes shoulder pain is failing to retract the shoulderblades throughout the press. Whenever we’re benching, we want to have our shoulder blades retracted or pinched together as if you were going to pinch a pencil between those blades. If we don’t have the shoulder blades retracted what actually tends to happen is the upper arm will round forward which can cause shoulder pain when benching. So what you want to do is before you press, depress your upper, and then pinch your shoulders blades together. Then, maintain this tightness by actively squeezing your shoulder blades together as you bench press, and avoid the mistake of opening up the shoulder blades and losing tightness at the bottom or as you push up.
        Another common mistake contributing to shoulder pain while bench pressing is benching with a completely flat back. Although most people won’t need an exaggerated arch as seen with powerlifters, you do want to ensure there’s some arch present between in your upper back. And the reason for this is similar to what we saw with retracting your shoulder blades, as a slight arch in the upper back places the glenohumeral joint in an externally rotated, safer position. But to properly implement this while avoiding injury, note that you’re not simply arching your lower back. What you want to do is arch your upper back instead by retracting your shoulder blades as we previously discussed, and then raise your chest up towards the ceiling which will naturally create space between your back and the bench which you then want to maintain as a solid base of support for your press.
        Next, to bench press without pain, you need to avoid the mistake of touching the bar too high on your chest while excessively flaring the elbows out at a 90 degree angle and pressing the bar straight up and down. This puts the shoulder in an internally rotated position and can thus cause pain when benching. So what you want to do is instead realize that the bar path of your bench press shouldn’t be straight up and down. It should actually start above your shoulder, come down to around the level of your sternum or nipple height and then curve diagonally back towards the starting point. And to achieve this without harming your shoulders, you need to tuck your elbows to roughly a 75-degree angle such that your elbows remain closer to the body and more or less directly under the bar throughout each rep. This will not only lead to a safer press, but a stronger one as well.
        Lastly, avoid the bench press form mistake of not having your elbows stacked under the bar. This creates unnecessary torque on the shoulder joint which can then cause shoulder pain. If your elbows are unaligned when viewed from the front or back, then the problem is likely with your grip width that needs adjusting. If your elbows are unaligned when viewed from the side, then it’s likely that you’re overtucking your elbows too close to your sides when you press. So to fix this, you simply want to adjust the angle of your elbow during the press by flaring them out a little more such that they remain relatively underneath the bar.
        Now if you want to see the best results then it’s vital that you not only choose the right exercises and variations, but that you also implement and progress them correctly within your routine. And this is exactly what my Built With Science programs do. They’re designed to be an all-in-one evidence-based program that optimizes all your training variables AND nutrition such that you’re able to progress as quickly as possible.

        muscle: 'Back',
        instruction: `In this video I discuss the best back training workout that utilizes exercises for a big back, as well as exercises for a wider back based on current scientific literature and our anatomical understanding of the back muscles. It’s important that you not only choose the right exercises when performing a back workout for mass, but to also perform these exercises in the correct fashion to target the right muscles. If you’re looking to add more mass, depth, and width to your upper back and lower back while targeting muscles that are important for scapular and shoulder stability, then this is the best back workout video for you. 

        Within the video I’m going to discuss 5 exercises that I believe are essential to grow a powerful and attractive looking back: the deadlift, pull-up, chest-supported row, lat pulldown, and scapular pull-up. 
        
        I will go through each of these exercises and show the muscle anatomy worked in each exercise, as well as the best variations of these exercises based on current research. It’s also equally important that you are targeting the right back muscles when you perform each of these exercises. I discuss a few “cues” and tips that have helped me minimize the involvement of secondary muscles and focus on using my back throughout each movement.

        instruction: `In this 2-part video series of the best bicep and tricep workout, I’m going to be discussing the best arm workout and the best arm exercises based on science (10 studies) and our anatomical understanding of the arms. In part 1 of this series, I will be discussing the best bicep exercises and the best bicep workout for size and shape. The bicep curls variations shown in this video will help tremendously in putting more mass on your arms and will help develop your “bicep peak”. But it’s important that you don’t simply think about “getting bigger biceps”, as that should be the goal but equally as important is the shape and definition of your biceps. In order to get well-defined biceps and arms you need to train each part of the biceps – the long head, the short head, and the brachialis (as well as the brachioradialis). All these components, if properly trained, will help build an aesthetic looking arm with size, shape, and definition.

        If you enjoyed this video, don’t forget to watch part 2 of this series when it’s out where I will be covering the best tricep exercises as shown by current scientific literature.

        workout:"triceps",
        instructions:`In this part 2 video of my arm series, I will discuss the best tricep workout to hit every triceps head based on current scientific literature and our anatomical understanding of the arms. Although it’s important to know that all 3 tricep heads (long head, lateral head, and medial head) will be activated in all movements, we can emphasize the involvement of each of them by choosing the right exercises for each head of the triceps which in a way will provide “tricep head isolation”. These exercises will not only help with increasing tricep size and getting bigger triceps with that “horseshoe triceps” effect, they will also help in improving the overall definition of your triceps and allowing each head to grow in proportion with each other. In my opinion, these are the best exercises for bigger triceps and putting on more tricep mass while keeping them in proportion.
